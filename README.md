### TCP 3-way Handshake

The 3-Way handshake is a TCP/IP network connection mechanism that connects the server and client.

A client must initiate a conversation by using the TCP handshake to request a communication session with the server.

Before the real data communication process begins, both the client and server must exchange synchronization and acknowledgment packages.

The client acknowledges the server's response in the final step.
