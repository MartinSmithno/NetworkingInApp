In this project we will discuss about basic;

- HTTP - HTTPS protocols,
- Networking rules

### TCP 3-way Handshake

The 3-Way handshake is a TCP/IP network connection mechanism that connects the server and client.

A client must initiate a conversation by using the TCP handshake to request a communication session with the server.

Before the real data communication process begins, both the client and server must exchange synchronization and acknowledgment packages.

The client acknowledges the server's response in the final step.


### TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

### Other Types of Protocols
- FTP (File Transfer Protocol),
- SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol),
- SSH (Secure Shell Protocol)
      The key difference between **SSH** vs **SSL** is that SSH is used for creating a secure tunnel to another computer from which you can issue commands, transfer data, etc. On the other end, SSL is used for securely transferring data between two parties.
